Greetings Rairians! We finally have a new map. It's aimed at roughly lv30-40, and has some fun stuff hidden in it. I'm excited to see who can figure out all the things in it first!

# Ancient Tree

Formerly the Tower of Serena, this tree spans the length from the continent of Risan down to the new jungle land of Elgun! Ain't it purty?

Featuring a new lair fight, a handful of quests, a lot of specifically-needed gear for progression, and an old damage type being utilized in fun, new ways!

To celebrate, I've made it so this map has +25% XP/Skill gain! I'll be doing this for all maps going forward, as well.

There is one portal in this map that doesn't work. This will, in the future, lead to an instanced encounter that I've yet to make (but will eventually ™️).

# ModKit Improvements

- the [Map Making](https://rair.land/docs/map-making/) guide has been improved slightly.
- the modkit can now override the database URL in case you need that
- lots of validations/etc to cover weird cases
- you can no longer delete things that are in use somewhere in the mod
# Balance Changes

- shields no longer block if you can't use them
- aoe spells no longer go through walls
- bouncing traits now use a different targetting mechanism
- ori/sol creatures get MP regen (also, lots of other balance fixes for them)
- XP formula has been adjusted post-20 to slowly increase towards 50. the end result is about an extra 1 billion XP needed across those 30 levels (previously 16b, now 17b).
- new trait: Familiar Skill - boosts the skill level of your familiars across the board!
- thief stealth is now drained at a rate of 2x
- improved hide has been made a /5 from a /1, improving how useful it actually is

# Other Fixes & Features

- rapidpunch no longer works at range
- transmute will only transmute 100 things at a time (lag reduction)
- gold sprites should all be visible now (one permutation was wrong)
- client $targetting macros will work while hidden now
- perf: no longer sending two copies of every player/creature effect to the client
- teleports that are self-map-referential (such as the sedgwick exit) work again
- traits that are learned will no longer be unlearned unless you no longer meet the requirements
- recipe books now show the skill required to learn them
- you can see your characters guild in the lobby now
- gemcrafting offense/defense rings are now given out in the correct order
- catacombs 5f dagger has had its level requirement fixed
- bile stew has a description now... as if you needed one
- usernames and emails are now checked case-insensitively when registering a new account (how did I fuck this up?). this means that you will no longer be able to register the following accounts: hellothere, HelloThere, hELLOtHErE - only the first one will be able to be created. this solves a few awkward issues that I somehow never ran into before!
- golden staff II recipe has had its item references fixed and should be craftable again
- the one kind of door in ori/solo that opened and showed an incorrect sprite has had that fixed
- some teleports are locked, and will not work until the game fully loads (ori/solo)
- better error logging for invalid content references so my email inbox can once again be pure
- email sending is now handled locally by my own server, and not a third party. unfortunately this means you might have to go to spam to find forgot password emails, but you'll get them again!
- better sorting of items for modkit purposes - unfortunately, some items (avatar items) will be lost and need to be obtained again. if this majorly affected you, please reach out and I will create a new one for you

As always you can find the full changelog [here](https://github.com/LandOfTheRair/LandOfTheRair/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md).

# What's Coming Up?

I want to add guild halls! This will be a customizable place that players can go as part of their guilds, and customize in interesting ways. I'm excited!

As always you can find the full roadmap [here](https://github.com/orgs/LandOfTheRair/projects/2/views/1).

Until next time,
