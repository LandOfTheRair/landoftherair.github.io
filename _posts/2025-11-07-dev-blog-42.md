Greetings Rairians! Lots of miscellaneous changes this patch. The biggest news: I'm considering Depths done, pending balance changes. Plenty of other interesting changes, though!

# Trinkets

What's that I spy? A new item slot? 👀

Trinkets are a concept that I've wanted to add for a very long time. They haven't yet taken the form I originally envisioned with Rair, but in fairness, I've also long since forgotten a lot of that core lore and I can't find my reference material, so changes are bound to happen. So lets talk trinkets.

What are they? They're a new kind of item that are only obtained by trading a rare item for them. They gain experience when you do, and can be leveled up by visiting the trinket giving NPC (location varies depending on the trinket). Each trinket has a different max level, exp scaling, and cost to level up. Additionally, since they level up, they give stats per _level_. This might seem insane, but consider that 0.2 INT is actually 0 INT until it becomes 1 INT. Stats are, thusly, rounded down until they become a whole number.

There are two in the game, and I wish you luck in finding them!

# Event Planning

There's a new NPC in the clubhouse! Planar lets you start festivals with gold. Two of them are copies of silver events (and stackable!): +100% XP and +100% Skill. However, there's a third one: 2x Spawn Rate. This means that respawns are _globally_ doubled! Monsters and resources respawn twice as fast, and elites will spawn twice as fast.

# Depths of Madness

As stated in the header, I am considering this map done for the purposes of content (at least, for a release version - more will probably be added). I've added a series of loot items that should be at least useful to one spec. In light of all of the weird nuances to keep in mind while making items, I've also made a guide on [Itemization](https://rair.land/docs/itemization/) for creators (and for myself), to help remember all of these cases.

Additionally, the completion of Depths means the opening of the Arcanist prestige class, officially. Cerist is now accessible, and best of luck in getting there! 

# Frozen Catacombs

Catacombs has gotten 6 quest givers. Thanks Cobra for the suggestion for 5 of them! The last one was one I thought would be fun.

# ModKit Improvements

As always, the modkit needs improvements because I keep finding bugs. A few changes:

- Trinkets are supported
- Quest-related NPC dialog entries should now work correctly
- Can only edit one thing at a time, and also the currently editing thing is shown in the title bar (I lose track when I do mass-edits!)
- Fix `mergeAndGiveItem` so it's used (a previous entry was duplicated but not renamed)

# Other Fixes & Features

- In preparation for larger-scale changes, Monk has gotten a new trait: Martial Weapons, which lets them hold a staff with no penalty
- Remaining craft disciplines have been added to the leaderboard
- Achievement counts have been added to the leaderboard
- Rune descriptions have been added to the codex
- NPC names should now propagate changes immediately, rather than sometimes or never
- Upgrades are now described in the text of an item (such as Offes, Deffes, or other upgrades)
- Directional AoEs no longer double-cast when casting directionally (rather than at a target)
- Distance formula is now chebyshev (rather than euclidean)
- Possibly fixed: client time offset for clients that do not have the same time as the server
- Builds can now be renamed in-game with a UI
- NPCs will grab offhand items and shields from the ground occasionally

As always you can find the full changelog [here](https://github.com/LandOfTheRair/LandOfTheRair/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md).

# What's Coming Up?

🤷 Not sure what's coming yet.

As always you can find the full roadmap [here](https://github.com/orgs/LandOfTheRair/projects/2/views/1).

Until next time,
