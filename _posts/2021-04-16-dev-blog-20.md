Hey everyone! Another week of spells and traits. Mage is complete now! Warrior is actually also really close - I only have two more specs to add for it, and I've already got a good start on Paladin. Warrior should be in a good spot next week. Also, stances have made their way back this week!

## Stances

Stances are permanent buffs that give you various effects. For Mages, they have opposite fire/ice stances that increase outgoing damage for each respective element. Fire stance makes it so you do damage when you attack, and ice stance makes it so when you take damage you can fight back with ice. 

Generally, stances will come in pairs to provide some varied options. For this reason, Warrior also has two stances (currently): parry and rage. Rage stance buffs their rage generation and outgoing damage, while parry significantly reduces their incoming damage. 

Warriors are a bit unique in that they need weapons to take a stance, but they need weapons for most of their abilities anyway so this isn't too strange.
