Hey everyone! Another week of spells and traits. Some good news: Healer is complete (notwithstanding new potential traits/spells), and Mage is _almost_ complete! Mage only has a few more spells to go for Battlemage and it's done as well. After that, onto Warrior and Thief, and those shouldn't be too bad compared to some of the Healer/Mage spells! Lets talk about the new features this week.

## Familiars

This week came with 9 new spells (2 reserved for holidays) that summon Familiars. Healers can summon a Light Spirit (heals allies), a Water Spirit (buffs allies) and a Nature Spirit (debuffs enemies). These are meant to augment Healers existing playstyles. Mages can summon a Bear (tank), Wolf (melee DPS), Chillspider (frost melee DPS), and a Salamander (fire magic DPS). Familiars will only exist in the zone you're currently in, so if you change maps, they'll poof. Additionally, your Familiars will grant a stat buff while they're up! And finally, they will follow you around. If they ever leave your vision, they'll come right back. You can use this to cart them around the map, as well.

## Party Damage

This is a pretty straightforward bit, but I wanted to mention it separately. You can no longer damage your allies with AOE spells (Mages rejoice!). This means the related traits (FriendlyFire) will no longer exist as they're unnecessary. It's tedious and unfun, so it's gone.

## Invisibility

I've also added Invisibility this week. This spell will, as you might guess, make you invisible, and unable to be seen. _In general_! If a creature has TrueSight, not only will they see hidden doors, but they'll see you being invisible. The average creatures don't have or cast this spell, so it can be used to recover gear or scout, but you have to be careful of those that do have it!

## Teleportation

Teleportation has come this week as well! If you learn the Teleport spell, you get access to some new commands: `memorize` and `forget`. You can use these spells to name any location in the game and teleport back to it later. However, some places cannot be memorized in - they'll let you know.

If you ever want to check your teleport locations, do `cast teleport` or `cast massteleport` without specifying a location; it will show them to you, something like this:

You can also learn the MassTeleport spell to transport groups of players to a location. And, finally, if you find yourself not having enough teleport locations, there is a trait that will let you learn more.
