Hey everyone! It's been a long time coming, but I'm basically ready for people to try out the Modkit.

# The Mod Kit

Honestly, I wrote a lot of documentation for the mod kit just before now. I'm pretty drained from that, but you can [find the docs over here](https://rair.land/docs/modkit/).

I would ask that you wait for me to release the next version (1.0.4) before checking it out, as there are a few important changes I need to make before the modkit tools are ready for users to use them for real. I just don't want to delay this post any more, or I might forget to write it ðŸ˜….

But, definitely check out the linked documentation above! It's informative and cool.

# Other Fixes & Features

Most of the features I shipped recently were related to the modkit, but here they are:

## Features

- the daily message was moved into the menu and off of the main screen
- custom content can now be loaded from mod kits
- there is now a server distribution built so players could host the game externally if they wanted to
- new server props for "test mode"

As always you can find the full changelog [here](https://github.com/LandOfTheRair/LandOfTheRair/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md).

# What's Coming Up?

A few fixes to make to the modkit, then probably a little or big break, then we'll see what comes up next!

As always you can find the full roadmap [here](https://github.com/LandOfTheRair/LandOfTheRair/projects/2).

Until next time,
