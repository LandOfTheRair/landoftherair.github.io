Hey everyone! This week was a little bit slow. To cut right to the chase, I added a few spells and small internal tweaks this week. Spells are an arduous task and there's _so many of them_ to pull back, so I've been doing as much as I can! A full listing of the spells that were added this week are as follows:

- Snare (Healer)
- Daze (Healer)
- Wellspring (Healer)
- SecondWind (Healer)
- Aid (Healer)
- Disease (Healer)
- BarNecro (Healer)
- BarFire (Healer, Mage)
- BarFrost (Healer, Mage)
- BarWater (Mage)
- Conjure Healing (Mage)
- Combust (Mage)
- Hail (Mage)
- Haste (Mage)
- Protection (Mage)
- Absorption (Mage)
- EagleEye (Thief)

I've also added Charge! Charge is now a Core trait that can be purchased by anyone. No restrictions.

I've also scaled back TP per level from 2 to 1. I will likely keep it this way, and award bonus TP in certain situations (such as a one time bonus of +3 when you hit a certain level, or some such). There just aren't enough traits to justify having 100 TP at level 50.

As always you can find the full changelog [here](https://github.com/LandOfTheRair/LandOfTheRair/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md).

# What's Coming Up?

More spells! More traits!

As always you can find the full roadmap [here](https://github.com/LandOfTheRair/LandOfTheRair/projects/2).

Until next time,
