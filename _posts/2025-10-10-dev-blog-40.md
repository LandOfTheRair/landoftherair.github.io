Greetings Rairians! This patch came with a lot of fun new toys to play with! New traits, new spells, new... many things! And some modkit improvements, and balance changes. This also comes with new spells that can be placed, and have an area of effect that sits there, as well as some changes surrounding AoEs (visually).

# New Traits 

- Thief: Longer Trap Effects - boosted trap buff duration
- Thief: Ventriloquism - chance of not using stealth when singing
- Thief: Dagger Excellence -all daggers can be used in the offhand 
- Warrior: Firm Grip - when using a single handed weapon and no offhand, increase the tier by 1
- Warrior: Smashing Board - shields are treated as maces for the purposes of damage
- Warrior: Main Gauche - offhand weapons have increased AC
- Ancient: Ancient Bartering - increase the sell value of items when selling to a merchant

# New Content

- New enemy in Ancient Tree with new rewards to slowly build up to some of the bandit cave rewards
- New enemy wandering the Frozen Catacombs (you'll know when you see him)
- Bandit cave has a glove drop (for monks)

# ModKit Improvements

- UI Improvements
- Spawner selection is now a dropdown instead of text (like NPC selection)
- Auto-trim text fields when saving them to prevent awkward spacing at beginning/end of text
- Default alignment of `neutral` is now correct
- Store page size in query params so it persists
  
# Balance Changes

- Creatures at higher levels are given 2x the accuracy they were before
- Mage Hail damage has gone up
- Extra walls have been added to the BCTD event
- Plague damage -20%
- Enemy poison damage +20%
- Antidote now cures Venom, too

# Other Fixes & Features

- VFX handling has been reworked so it no longer bleeds through walls, or shows on walls. this should make the new visual effects much more tolerable.
- Outgoing DoT damage is now displayed (and correspondingly can be turned off)
- Barbarians have level up achievements added
- Enter will no longer toggle the command line when modal popups are on the screen
- Skill page in-game now should not break between lines when showing +s
- Dryads now drop their missing robes

As always you can find the full changelog [here](https://github.com/LandOfTheRair/LandOfTheRair/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md).

# What's Coming Up?

Probably some modkit improvements (there are a lot of them needed), some small tweaks, and work on Depths of Madness.

As always you can find the full roadmap [here](https://github.com/orgs/LandOfTheRair/projects/2/views/1).

Until next time,
