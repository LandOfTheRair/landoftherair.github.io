            <blockquote>
              <p>The Land of the Rair is a game inspired by the MUDs of olde. You begin as an intrepid adventurer who joins a vast new world.
                You're given a piece of armor and a weapon, and from there, you get to stake your claim in the world. Kill monsters, solve puzzles,
                defeat those who oppose the ways of the realm, and find your place amongst the ranks of the greatest heroes to travel the land.</p>
