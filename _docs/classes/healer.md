Healers are a great support class, bringing heals and buffs to the party. Make no mistake: they can also do physical combat or magical combat - they can inflict an assortment of damage over time spells upon their foes. They're a bit of a hybrid in that regard. When you feel the itch to learn new spells, you can talk to a healer trainer and if you're ready, he'll teach you new spells.

Healers can hold any weapon, but in general they might hold a staff for a stat bonus, and/or a set of amulets for mp regen. They can also hold a totem to increase their damage output.

When a healer levels up, it will gain some hp (more than a mage) and some mp (less than mages). They don't have any other innate bonuses.
