# The Warrior

Warriors are a simple class. You point, you hit. Since they can use any weapon, they don't learn skills the traditional way (that is, by talking to the trainer), they just innately know how to use their weapon in new, stronger ways. 

In general, two-handed weapons will do the most damage, but carry defensive penalties (such as not being able to use a shield). One-handed weapons do less damage, but they offer the ability to hold a shield. Alternatively, you can dual wield some weapons to deal more damage.

As warriors level up, they'll gain a lot of hp (compared to other classes), and they also gain offensive and defensive bonuses every 5 levels.
