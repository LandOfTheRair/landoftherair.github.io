Parties can include any number of people, however after a certain point skill/xp gain gets cut. Once you've added your fifth member, your experience and skill gain will go down by 25%. Once you've added your eighth player, experience and skill go down by an additional 25%.

You cannot gain xp or skill if you aren't within 7 tiles of your party members.

If you are more than 5 levels away from the average party level, your xp gain is cut by 50%, and if you're more than 10 levels away from the average party level, you will not gain xp.
