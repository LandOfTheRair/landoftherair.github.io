Welcome to Rylt, the first player town in Land of the Rair! There is a lot of cool stuff around the town that a first player definitely is going to need to know about, so check out the listing below!

# The Tavern

The tavern is the northwest-most building in the town of Rylt.

The tavern is home to Bradley, the tavernkeep. Bradley has one main focus: to keep you from having low CON (Constitution). When you die, you lose a point of CON, and when you get too low, it gets dangerous to be an adventurer. You will want to replenish your CON periodically by buying his potions.

The tavern also has a locker. Lockers are where you store your gear when it's not in use. You generally keep special, old, or alternate equipment sets in them.

# The Mage Trainer

The Mage trainer building is east of the tavern, top-middle in the town of Rylt.

The Mage trainer is where you go when you want to learn new skills as a Mage, or level up. To learn new skills, you'll want to open the Trait window and spend your trait points - the first Mage skill is Magic Missile.

# The Fighter Trainer

The Fighter trainer building is east of the Mage trainer, up the long path.

The Fighter trainer is where you go when you want to learn new skills as a Fighter, or level up. To learn new skills, you'll want to open the Trait window and spend your trait points.

# The Healer Trainer

The Healer trainer building is east of the Mage trainer, top-right in the town of Rylt.

The Healer trainer is where you go when you want to learn new skills as a Healer, or level up. To learn new skills, you'll want to open the Trait window and spend your trait points - the first Healer skills are Cure and Afflict.

# The Thief Trainer

The Thief trainer is hidden around town! Try to find him.

# The Mayor

The Mayor resides outside of town, way to the northeast.

The Mayor gives you daily quests to kill different types of creatures that are plaguing Rylt, rewarding you with XP and Gold.

# The Encruster

South of the Healer trainer, the east-most building in Rylt is the Encruster.

The Encruster is used to attach gems to your weapons and armor. Encrusting gems into your gear will add bonus stats to them! With a little bit of experimentation, you can find a good gear loadout for your character.

# The Market/Bank Building

South-east most in Rylt, near the Encruster building, is the Market/Bank building. 

This building houses both the Banker and the local Steelrose Agent. 

The Banker will let you deposit or withdraw gold. 

The Steelrose Agent acts as a way to access the market board, letting you buy, sell, and retrieve items from the market board.

# The Smith Building

South of the Market/Bank building is the Smith building.

The Smith serves many functions:

* Repairs your gear (it will break over time!)
* Allow you to practice metalworking
* Collect your ore (for metalworkers only)
* Forge gear (if you hold an item mold and an ingot, he will create a piece of gear for you)

# The Armor/Weapon/Misc Vendor Building

The big building to the W of the Market/Bank building houses many vendors. Here, you can buy basic weapons, armor, and two other items, which are an Identify ring and a Succor ring.

The Identify ring, when held or worn, will let you `cast identify` which lets you see more information about an item you're holding.

The Succor ring, when held or worn, will let you `cast succor` which lets you "remember" the place you currently are. If you eat the item it creates, you'll warp back to where you originally created it.

**It is strongly advised that you have a full set of gear before going on an adventure!**

# Last Chance

The Last Chance is W of the big vendor building.

The Last Chance is home to Guard Jarek, and many criminals who've done harm to Rylts prosperity. Talking to Jarek will give you a quest to kill prisoners. To find them, just go downstairs.

**This is where you should start killing creatures, as it will be the easiest place to do so!**

# Tanner Building

The Tanner building is to the west of the Last Chance.

The Tanner in this building, when told to `tan` something, can take wild animals and give you their furs. Some creatures, such as bears, will provide a fur (armor) that provides good fire and ice resistance. Other creatures such as deer provide a cloak (robe) that provides good energy and necrotic resistance.

**You will want to kill some deer!**

# Potion Building

The Potion building is the building on the far W of the town. 

This building contains a potion vendor and an alchemist. 

The potion vendor sells plain potions as well as ink/scrolls that can be written on.

The alchemist will let you practice alchemy (right click him or tell him `learn`), and he will also combine potions for you, which will make your potions last longer.
