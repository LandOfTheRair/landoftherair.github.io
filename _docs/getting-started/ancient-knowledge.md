Once you get to level 50, you can start gaining Ancient Knowledge by talking to an NPC named Alterna. It is a form of alternate advancement that replaces your XP gain with a new type of gain: AXP (Ancient XP). Ancient XP is gained differently, and more slowly. It can be gained from the following sources:

* Elite creatures (+1 AXP)
* Boss creatures (+5 AXP)

You can only gain AXP if your level is within 10 levels of the creature being killed. If you're level 50, and the creature is level 39, you will not get any AXP.

When you reach 100 AXP, you can trade it for 1 AP by talking to your class trainer and using the "Ancient" option.

AP is used to buy Ancient Traits.
