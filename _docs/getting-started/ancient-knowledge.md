Once you get to level 30, you can start gaining Ancient Knowledge by talking to an NPC named Alterna. It is a form of alternate advancement that replaces your XP gain with a new type of gain: AXP (Ancient XP). Ancient XP is gained differently, and more slowly. It can be gained from the following sources:

* Elite creatures (+1 AXP)
* Boss creatures (+5 AXP)

When you reach 100 AXP, you can trade it for 1 AP by talking to your class trainer and using the "Ancient" option.

AP is used to buy Ancient Traits.
