Gemcrafting is a tradeskill in Land of the Rair, defined by it's ability to break down gems and create new ones.

To learn Gemcrafting, go to any Encruster.

As a Gemcrafter, you'll be able to shatter gems to acquire varying kinds of gem dust. If you use the Shatter macro with an item in your right hand, you'll attempt to Shatter that item. However, if your right hand is empty, it will attempt to do a mass-shatter based on valid items in your sack.
