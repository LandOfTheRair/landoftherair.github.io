Survival is a simple tradeskill. As you gather natural resources (ore, wood, and flowers) your skill goes up. As your skill goes up, you have a higher chance to get more materials randomly from those gathering nodes.

Additionally, you can tan creatures in the wild. It costs durability and requires a sharp weapon, but you can stand atop a corpse and do `tan` to attempt to tan it. The success chance goes up the higher your Survival skill is. This action will also gain you skill no matter if you succeed or fail.

### Useful Macros

* Tan: `tan` - Attempt to tan all corpses on your tile.
