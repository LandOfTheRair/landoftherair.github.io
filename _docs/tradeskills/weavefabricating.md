Weavefabricating is a tradeskill in Land of the Rair, defined by it's ability to break down soft armor to create soft armor items such as robes, sashes, gloves, and boots.

To learn Weavefabricating, go to any Tanner.

As a Weavefabricator, you'll be able to tear rare items (cloth items) to acquire varying kinds of thread. If you use the Tear macro with an item in your right hand, you'll attempt to Tear that item. However, if your right hand is empty, it will attempt to do a mass-tear based on valid items in your sack.
