Spellforging is a tradeskill in Land of the Rair, defined by it's ability to disenchant items, enchant items, and attach runes to items.

To learn Spellforging, go to any Magician.

As a Spellforger, you'll be able to disenchant rare items (items with quality ratings) to acquire varying kinds of magic dust. If you use the Disenchant macro with an item in your right hand, you'll attempt to Disenchant that item. However, if your right hand is empty, it will attempt to do a mass-disenchant based on valid items in your sack.
