## Droptables

![](https://i.imgur.com/ucC2z9D.png)

After creating at least one map and one item, you can add Droptables. These are how players get map- or region-based loot.

You can choose either a map or region drop (based on the maps you've created), an item (based on your items), a chance to drop (if you set it to 100, it will drop 1/100 of the time), whether the player luck bonus should be used (this makes it easier to find items), and if the item only drops on a certain holiday. You can also choose if it should be a global droptable, which means it will show up in every region.
