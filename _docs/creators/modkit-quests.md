## Quests

![](https://i.imgur.com/wmvYuJG.png)

In the left column, you can set the quest name, description, and giver. The description and giver are display only for the in-game quest log. You can also toggle whether the quest is a repeatable quest (you can repeat it immediately upon completion) or a daily quest (you can do it at most once per day).

In the middle column, you can set the quest type, and all variables related to that. Most quests will either be "none", "item", or "kill".

In the right column, you can choose the rewards for the quest.
