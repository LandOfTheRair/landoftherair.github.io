## Tiled Settings

You should change these settings to ON, or you're going to have a bad time:

- View -> Snapping -> Snap to Grid

## Creating a Map

When creating a map, it should follow these constraints:

### Map Structure

There **must** be a gutter (margin) of 4 tiles on each edge of the map (see any map for an example). Otherwise, the camera will get messed up.

### Map Layers

Each map should have these map layers (in order; if you copy a map, they will be):

#### ZLevel

This is an object layer that uses _only_ rectangle objects. It's used to specify what's above or below what on the map.

#### SpawnerZones

This is a legacy layer, don't use it for anything.

#### Succorport

This is an object layer that uses _only_ rectangle objects. The rectangle object name sets the region name in succor/teleport. You can use this to restrict teleporting/succoring/both.

#### BackgroundMusic

This is an object layer that uses _only_ rectangle objects. The rectangle object name sets the BGM played in the region.

#### RegionDescriptions

This is an object layer that uses _only_ rectangle objects. The rectangle objects set the description for the area contained inside of it. Additionally, if there is no succorport, any succor/teleports will use the name of this RegionDescription.

#### Spawners

This is an object layer specifically for spawners. Generally, they are restricted to the pylon sprite to prevent confusion.

#### NPCs

This is an object layer for specific scripted NPCs. This typically includes shops, quest givers, and the like.

#### Interactables

This is an object layer for anything interactable - doors, stairs, portals, or map event tiles. A full listing is provided below in "Additional Objects".

#### OpaqueDecor

This is an object layer for decorative things that should not be see-through-able but can be walked through. Typically, secret walls are put on this layer.

#### DenseDecor

This is an object layer for decorative things that should also not be walk-through-able (but can be seen through). Typically, counters are put on this layer.

#### Decor

This is an object layer for decorative things such as beds, barrels, etc.

#### Walls

This is a layer specifically for walls. Sparingly, trees may also be placed here to make them opaque/dense.

#### Foliage

This is a layer specifically for trees and plants.

#### Fluids

This is a layer for water and lava only. Do not put anything else (ie, pools, fountains) on this layer.

#### Floors

This is another visual layer on top of terrain, it has no effect other than affecting visual tile layering. Typically carpets, bone piles, etc will go on this layer.

#### Terrain

This is the base layer and is the tile that is the general basis of your map - grass, dirt, tile, etc.

### Optional Map Properties

Maps have optional properties that can be set:

- `maxCreatures` (Controls the maximum number of creatures on the map. When set to 0, spawners will only spawn their minimal number. default: 1)
- `maxSkill` (Controls the max skill you can gain skill points at for this map. default: 1)
- `maxLevel` (Controls the max level you can gain xp at for this map. default: 1)
- `region` (Controls the region this map belongs to. Affects banks, lockers, regional drop tables)
- `itemExpirationHours` (Controls how many hours it takes for items to decay on this map. default: 6)
- `itemGarbageCollection` (Controls how many minutes it takes for item garbage collection checks to occur. default: 60)
- `maxItemsOnGround` (Controls the max items on ground before decay is forced to start. default: 1000)

## Making a Map More Easily

- Use the terrain brush to place water, carpets, tiles, floors, etc. It will automatically place edges for you. Hold CTRL to make it place a 2x2 instead of 3x3. To place a 1-wide, you'll have to do that manually.
- To place trees, use the random (dice) button. Ctrl-select multiple trees, then place them using the brush. This will help avoid an unnatural-feeling forested area.

## Map Guidelines

These are in no particular order, but in order to make it easier on both of us. When in doubt, ask, or check an existing map to see how it is done there.

- Maps need 4 buffer tiles on each of the edges. The first tile you can place is at 4,4.
- Do not make maps greater than 200x200. You do not have the patience nor the time to fill it properly with the details, especially if it is your first map. Start small, expand if you need to. Also, large maps do not work well within the game engine - 250x250 (Frostlands) is the largest map currently, and while I would like to push the boundaries, it requires testing.
- When placing walls, do not transition directly from one wall into another (ie, gray cave to gold cave).
- Do not use too many terrain/wall tiles in an area. If you have more than 3 unique walls in your zone, you probably are using too many. Consistency is key.
- Use decor. If you don't have any decoration, your map will feel empty.
- Remember, the player viewport is a 7x7 field of view. Do not make areas too large or plain, or they'll be unremarkable.
- When making cave areas, or areas in caves, try to make the cave look more natural (do not make a giant flat wall the whole way).
- Do not use "shiny" rugs. Maybe some day, but not today.
- Do not put anything on the spawner or NPC layer. I will have to remove them and edit them to make them work.
- Make all of your teleports work correctly.
- Do not "hide" things in general (such as invisible traps). Players should not be blindsided by things in an unpredictable manner.
- Only put counters on DenseDecor.
- Only put secret walls on OpaqueDecor.
- Do not place interactables that are not valid. See above for valid interactables. Most of them will be doors or teleports.
- Please put RegionDescriptions on your map, and spell check them. I will do a final review of them. If you're curious how to do that, pull one from another map via copy/paste.
- You can put BGM if you want to. Copy and paste from another map if you're unsure how it works.
- The Succorport layer is only necessary if you want to restrict succor/teleport in a particular zone. Usually, this is used for lairs or progression areas to prevent skipping.
- The ZLevel layer is only necessary if you have areas in your map that are above/below others.
- The SpawnerZones layer is not something you should interact with unless you know how it works.
