## Items

Items are fairly straightforward, as most of the fields are ones you'd recognize from interacting with them.

### Core Stats

In the left column, you can set the required settings for an item:

- Sprite - Using the arrow keys will let you traverse sprites if you don't know the number you want.
- Type - All items are required to have a type. Setting the type will reset some other settings, so be cautious while setting this.

In the middle column, you can choose what stats the item boosts.

In the right column, if applicable, there will be miscellaneous settings that pertain to specific item types.

### Traits, Effects & Requirements

In the left column, you can set the pre-set trait for the item.

In the middle column, you can choose the effects that trigger when the item is used, when it hits something, when it's equipped, or when it's broken.

In the right column, you can set the required class and level for the item.

### Miscellaneous

Here, you can choose the cosmetic for an item. If the "Permanent Cosmetic" checkbox is checked, the cosmetic _can not_ be taken out of the item. This should be checked for most items.
