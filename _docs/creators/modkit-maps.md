## Maps

Here, you can import or create new maps. To get started, it's recommend to hit "Create New". This will create a map with the default settings, pathing, and sprite locations set up correctly.

Once created, you can continue to edit your maps as needed. For more help, check the [map making guide](https://rair.land/docs/map-making/).
