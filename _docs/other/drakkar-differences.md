A very common question for those who've played Kingdom of Drakkar is: "What's different about this game?"

I want to take a page to talk about the differences. Some will be small and inconsequential but some are large and not knowing about them might be jarring. So, here are all of the differences (in no particular order):

* The UI is entirely rearrangeable (sometimes resizable) and will remember where it is always.
* There are filters on the message log for environment messages, chat messages, and combat messages.
* When a piece of gear is too damaged, it gets a halo.
* When a piece of gear is encrusted, you can see the gem it was encrusted with in the top-right corner.
* When a piece of gear is encrusted with specific gems, it will gain bonuses (based on the gem).
* You have a dedicated potion slot, which the `~drink` macro will take from first. If nothing, it will take from your sack (the closest item to the top).
* Bottles show how many ounces they have in the top left corner.
* There is an Alchemist NPC that will let you combine bottles into bigger ounces.
* The Smith can repair all gear you're wearing and holding.
* Succor blobs show the map they originated in.
* There are multiple tradeskills that aren't shoehorned into the "brewing" aspect.
* There is an "active target" box showing an accurate percentage of their HP, an HP bar, their alignment towards you and their direction, and what buffs/debuffs they have.
* There is more verbosity in buffs; if you have low CON, the game puts a buff in there. If a piece of gear would give you a buff, it's added there.
* Casting elemental spells repeatedly will "build up" for an effect on the enemy. For fire, it will create a burn. For ice, it will chill (and slow the target actions).
* Status effects such as stun, burn, and chill have "recently" effects, which means for a few seconds afterwards you can't get stunned, burned, or chilled again. This prevents you from getting chain-stunned over and over.
* There are daily quests with a daily reset timer very visible.
* There are daily purchaseable RNG boxes.
* Equipment slots say what type of gear goes there.
* Dragging a piece of gear will show you all places it can be dropped.
* The stats, skills windows update in realtime.
* Parties show you the location of your party members, making it easier to find their corpse.
* Traits (quirks) are fairly similar, but they're more flexible. Some proc at >90% HP, and some improve your chances to not drop gear on death.
* You can boost your trait level significantly by adding a trait to a piece of gear with a Rune Scroll.
* Most internal commands (`critsort enable`, etc) are options instead of commands.
* Macros are significantly more flexible. When creating a macro, you can more easily select an icon. You can also customize the foreground and background colors for the icon. Additionally, you can execute multiple commands by separating them with semicolons, and if you have to target something, it will append the target to _all_ macros. So, if you do `cast firemist;cast icemist`, set it as "needs target" and click on a creature, it will queue both of those actions for the same creature.
* You can have multiple visible macro groups at once. 
* There are true instanced dungeons. Meaning, if someone forgets to close the Nameless Lord - you'd have to wait for game reset. In this game, if it's in the dungeon there is no wait period.
* Character creation provides fixed stats, no roller.
* Identify (sense) provides much more information about an object.
* Lairs do not strip to their danger zone - they all strip to a safe location. Safe is relative - deep in a dungeon is not safe to run back to, necessarily, but it is not in the lair so retrieving it is simplified.
* Wardrobes (lockers) that are all in the same region are accessible from each other.
* You can see your other region bank totals from the bank.
* Banks are shared across the account, instead of per character.
* There is (currently) no way to PM in lobby. Instead, use of Discord is encouraged. The lobby chat is linked to discord.
* You level up at a trainer instead of leveling up by using `rest`.
* There are quests to change alignment; you do not change by going on a killing spree.
* Dark tiles are visible when you have DarkVision (infravision).
* Lots of spell differences/additions/removals.
* You have to regularly be nourished (eat food or drink water), or you will be malnourished. Different foods add different stats, and malnourishment is a -1 to every stat. You will be malnourished if you go without food for 8 hours.
* There is no "teleport limit" so you can teleport freely between maps (succor or teleport). You don't have to be in a map to teleport to a location in it.
* NPCs fighting other NPCs and getting a kill shot will not trigger loot drops.
* Buffs last longer in general.
* Different classes have different internal growths. For example, Warriors gain +1/1 every 5 levels.
* Better GM (sysop) tools. Things can be created from scratch, duped, fixed etc as necessary.
* Playable on web or desktop.
