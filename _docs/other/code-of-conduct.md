Let's keep it positive in here!

- Be respectful and kind to other members
- Don't send offensive messages or have an offensive nickname
- No spam
- Don't harass other members
- Use the appropriate channels where possible
- Please keep politics and religion chat to a minimum
- Don't advertise other Discords without prior approval
- Remember, the game is connected via the #lobby channel and we try to keep an eye on it (for moderation and engagement purposes), but if something needs to be brought to our attention, ping @GM.

Not following these guidelines can result in a ban or mute either in game, in Discord, or both.
